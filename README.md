## Thesis:
While social media is often blamed for reducing real-life interactions and harming productivity, this dashboard reveals a contrasting reality. Data on usage, income, education, and job creation shows that higher social media engagement correlates with improved economic outcomes and increased proactive behavior, suggesting that social media may actually empower and connect users rather than diminish their abilities.

## Context:
**Who**: Current and non-Users wrestling between their continued use of social media in their daily schedules.

**What**: Increased social media usage has proven to indicate higher rates of income and greater levels of education compared to the average individual not partaking in social media; consider increasing social media intake for better mental health and well-being.

**How**: Illustrate the significance of social media usage on mental health treatment and overall well-being by contrasting it to the income, education, interaction, and job creation statistics of the average individual in the US.

## Data: 
**Sets Used for Data Visualization**: 
* https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com
* https://www.statista.com/statistics/235515/jobs-created-by-start-ups-in-the-us/
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lastman0800/impact-of-social-media-dataset

## Strategies Used: 
* Summarize functionalities of the components (making text on graphs and dropdown more readable)
* Use slope graph to emphasize the difference between two percentage values
* Highlight dual positive trends between job creation and social media usage in the US by side-by-side line graph comparisons
* Made important bar statistics on graphs and charts to correspond with rest of the app layout to emphasize its importance (less important data is displayed in grey)
* Employed white space in both my Plotly dash and presentation/separated sections in boxes
* Visuals are not stretched to take up the available space; instead, appropriately sized to my content
* All text in the visual is the same size except where decisions were made to further emphasize or de‚Äêemphasize components
* The graph titles are larger and bolded
